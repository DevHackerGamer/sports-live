# Live Input ESPN Tables Synchronization - Changes Summary

## Problem Statement
1. **Live input was not affecting ESPN tables**: When using the LiveInput component to add events, lineups, commentary, or statistics, the data was only saved to regular collections but not to ESPN-specific tables.
2. **Limited league availability**: Only one league (esp.1) was showing up in the competition selector when creating new matches.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Competitions API (`api/competitions.js`)
**Changed**: Now fetches competitions from both `Match_Info` and `Match_Info_ESPN` collections and merges them.

**Result**: All available competitions from both regular and ESPN collections will now appear in the dropdown when creating matches.

### 2. Match Statistics API (`api/match-statistics.js`)
**Changed**: 
- `PUT` operation now updates both `Match_Statistics` AND `Match_Statistics_ESPN` collections simultaneously

**Result**: Statistics entered via LiveInput will now be visible in ESPN-sourced match displays.

### 3. Match Commentary API (`api/match-commentary.js`)
**Changed**:
- `POST` operation now writes to both `Match_Commentary` AND `Match_Commentary_ESPN` collections

**Result**: Live commentary added through LiveInput will now show up in all match viewers.

### 4. Match Lineups API (`api/match-lineups.js`)
**Changed**:
- `POST` operation now writes to both `Match_Lineups` AND `Match_Lineups_ESPN` collections
- `DELETE` operation now removes from both collections

**Result**: Lineups edited through LiveInput will now be reflected everywhere.

### 5. Matches API (`api/matches.js`)
**Changed**:
- `POST` (create match) now inserts into both `Match_Info` AND `Match_Info_ESPN` collections
- `PUT` (update match) now updates both collections
- `DELETE` (delete match) now removes from both collections AND deletes statistics from both stat collections
- Event operations (POST/PUT/DELETE) now affect both match collections

**Result**: 
- Admin-created matches will now appear in ESPN-based feeds
- Match updates (status, clock, etc.) will be reflected across both systems
- Events added via LiveInput will show up everywhere

## Technical Details

### Collections Affected
- `Match_Info` ↔️ `Match_Info_ESPN`
- `Match_Statistics` ↔️ `Match_Statistics_ESPN`
- `Match_Commentary` ↔️ `Match_Commentary_ESPN`
- `Match_Lineups` ↔️ `Match_Lineups_ESPN`

### How It Works
All write operations (POST, PUT, DELETE) now use `Promise.all()` to write to both collections simultaneously, ensuring data consistency between the regular and ESPN tables.

Example:
```javascript
await Promise.all([
  collection.updateOne(filter, update),
  collectionESPN.updateOne(filter, update)
]);
```

## Benefits
1. ✅ **Data Consistency**: Live input changes are immediately reflected in both collection sets
2. ✅ **Full Competition List**: All leagues now appear when creating matches
3. ✅ **Unified Display**: Whether data comes from ESPN API or admin input, it's treated uniformly
4. ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality preserved, just enhanced

## Testing Recommendations
1. Create a new match in LiveInput and verify it appears in the match list
2. Add events, update statistics, edit lineups - verify changes persist
3. Check that all competitions are available in the dropdown
4. Verify that matches show correct data whether they're ESPN-sourced or admin-created

## Notes
- This is a synchronization enhancement - the ESPN ingestor scripts can still populate ESPN tables independently
- Both table sets remain functional independently, but are now kept in sync during manual operations
- No data migration needed - existing data in both tables remains intact
