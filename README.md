## Data providers

Two ingest pipelines are available. The original Football-Data.org implementation remains intact, and a new ESPN-based implementation can be enabled via environment variable.

- football-data.org (default; requires `FOOTBALL_API_TOKEN`)
- ESPN public site APIs (no token required)

Configure via environment variables:

- `DATA_PROVIDER=football-data` (default) or `DATA_PROVIDER=espn`
- `ESPN_LEAGUES` (optional) comma-separated list like `ita.1,eng.1,uefa.champions`

When `DATA_PROVIDER=espn`, the server will periodically fetch:

- League scoreboard (fixtures and IDs)
- Match summary (stats/boxscore)
- Play-by-play (commentary timeline)

All data is normalized into existing MongoDB collections so existing APIs continue to work:

- `Match_Info` with normalized fields (homeTeam, awayTeam, competition, utcDate, status, score, events)
- `Match_Statistics` populated from ESPN boxscore
- `Match_Lineups` populated when available
- `Match_Commentary` stores raw ESPN commentary for reference
- `Event_Log` contains scoring events with rolling `scoreAfter`

Dev-only manual refresh:

- `GET /api/admin-refresh-matches`
