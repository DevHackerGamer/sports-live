# Live Input & Match Creation Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Live Input Not Affecting ESPN Tables
**Problem**: Changes made in LiveInput (events, lineups, commentary, statistics) were only saved to regular collections, not ESPN tables.

**Solution**: All write operations now update BOTH regular and ESPN collections simultaneously.

**Files Modified**:
- `api/match-statistics.js` - PUT operation updates both collections
- `api/match-commentary.js` - POST operation writes to both collections
- `api/match-lineups.js` - POST and DELETE operations affect both collections
- `api/matches.js` - POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE operations affect both collections
- `api/matches.js` - Event operations (add/edit/delete) update both collections

### 2. ✅ Limited League Availability
**Problem**: Only one league (esp.1) was showing in competition dropdown.

**Solution**: Competitions endpoint now fetches from both Match_Info and Match_Info_ESPN collections and merges them.

**Files Modified**:
- `api/competitions.js` - Now queries both collections and deduplicates

### 3. ✅ Too Many Teams in Dropdown
**Problem**: Match creation showed ALL teams including non-ESPN teams that aren't backed by the API.

**Solution**: Teams endpoint now ONLY returns teams from Teams_ESPN collection by default.

**Files Modified**:
- `api/teams.js` - Defaults to Teams_ESPN collection, sorted alphabetically
- Added `?source=all` query parameter for admin override if needed

### 4. ✅ Matches Not Appearing After Creation
**Problem**: Matches created in MatchSetup didn't immediately appear in the LiveSports view.

**Solution**: Added BroadcastChannel messaging to trigger refresh across components.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/matchsetup/MatchSetup.js` - Added broadcast on create and delete

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dual Collection Strategy
All write operations now use `Promise.all()` to write to both collections:

```javascript
await Promise.all([
  collection.updateOne(filter, update),
  collectionESPN.updateOne(filter, update)
]);
```

### Collection Pairs Synchronized
- `Match_Info` ↔️ `Match_Info_ESPN`
- `Match_Statistics` ↔️ `Match_Statistics_ESPN`
- `Match_Commentary` ↔️ `Match_Commentary_ESPN`
- `Match_Lineups` ↔️ `Match_Lineups_ESPN`

### Cross-Component Communication
Uses BroadcastChannel API with localStorage fallback:
```javascript
const bc = new BroadcastChannel('sports-live');
bc.postMessage({ type: 'matches-updated', matchId: id });
bc.close();
localStorage.setItem('sports:refresh', String(Date.now()));
```

### Teams Filtering
- **Default**: Only Teams_ESPN (API-backed teams)
- **Override**: `GET /api/teams?source=all` returns all teams
- **Benefit**: Prevents selection of teams without API data

## How to Use

### Creating a Match
1. Go to Match Setup
2. Select from **ESPN-backed teams only** (automatically filtered)
3. Select from **all available competitions** (merged from both sources)
4. Match appears immediately in Live Sports view (via broadcast)

### Using Live Input
1. Select any match (ESPN or admin-created)
2. Add events, update statistics, edit lineups, input commentary
3. Changes persist to **BOTH** regular and ESPN collections
4. Data is visible everywhere regardless of data source

### Admin Override (if needed)
- Get all teams: `GET /api/teams?source=all`
- Useful for debugging or special cases

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Data Consistency**: Single source of truth across both collection sets
2. ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Matches appear immediately after creation
3. ✅ **Clean UI**: Only relevant teams in dropdowns
4. ✅ **Full Competition List**: All leagues available for match creation
5. ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality preserved
6. ✅ **ESPN Integration**: Admin-created matches now integrate with ESPN data flow

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a new match in MatchSetup
- [ ] Verify it appears immediately in LiveSports view
- [ ] Verify only ESPN teams are in team dropdown
- [ ] Verify all competitions are in competition dropdown
- [ ] Add events via LiveInput
- [ ] Update statistics via LiveInput
- [ ] Edit lineups via LiveInput
- [ ] Input commentary via LiveInput
- [ ] Verify all changes persist and appear in match viewer
- [ ] Delete a match and verify it disappears from all views

## API Endpoints Modified

### GET /api/teams
- **Default**: Returns only Teams_ESPN collection (ESPN-backed teams)
- **Override**: `?source=all` returns all teams
- **Sorted**: Alphabetically by team name

### GET /api/competitions
- Returns merged competitions from both Match_Info and Match_Info_ESPN
- Automatically deduplicates

### POST /api/matches
- Creates match in both Match_Info and Match_Info_ESPN
- Triggers cross-component refresh via BroadcastChannel

### PUT /api/matches/:id
- Updates match in both collections
- Syncs clock, status, minute, etc.

### DELETE /api/matches/:id
- Removes from both match collections
- Removes from both statistics collections

### POST/PUT/DELETE /api/matches/:id/events
- Syncs events to both match collections
- Updates Event_Log for canonical record

### PUT /api/match-statistics
- Updates both Match_Statistics and Match_Statistics_ESPN

### POST /api/match-commentary
- Writes to both Match_Commentary and Match_Commentary_ESPN

### POST/DELETE /api/match-lineups
- Syncs to both Match_Lineups and Match_Lineups_ESPN

## Notes

- ESPN ingestor scripts can still populate ESPN tables independently
- Both table sets remain functional independently but are kept in sync
- No data migration needed - existing data intact
- BroadcastChannel works across tabs in same browser
- localStorage fallback ensures compatibility

## Future Enhancements

- Consider periodic background sync job to ensure consistency
- Add data integrity checks between collection pairs
- Consider consolidating to single collection set in future
