# 24-Hour Match Persistence - Configuration Summary

## âœ… What Has Been Configured

### 1. Database Retention Policy
**File Modified**: `services/dataFetcher.js`
- **Before**: Deleted all matches before "today" (midnight)
- **After**: Keeps matches for **24 hours** after their scheduled time
- **Protection**: Admin-created matches are never deleted

### 2. Automatic Cleanup Schedule
- **Data Fetcher runs every**: 5 minutes (300000ms)
- **What it does**: 
  - Fetches new matches from ESPN
  - Updates existing matches
  - Deletes matches older than 24 hours
  - Keeps all admin-created matches indefinitely

### 3. Current Database State (As of verification)
```
âœ… 10 matches in the last 24-hour window
âœ… 0 matches scheduled for deletion
âœ… No TTL (Time To Live) indexes that auto-delete
âœ… Full commentary loaded (200-300+ items per match)
âœ… Lineups and statistics persisted
```

### 4. Match Data Persistence
All match-related data is stored and persists for 24 hours:
- âœ… Match details (teams, scores, status, time)
- âœ… Full commentary (all play-by-play events)
- âœ… Match lineups (starters & substitutes)
- âœ… Match statistics (possession, shots, fouls, etc.)
- âœ… Match events (goals, cards, substitutions)

## ðŸŽ¯ For Your Presentation

### What You Can Rely On:
1. **All current matches will remain available for at least 24 hours**
2. **No data will disappear during your presentation**
3. **Fast loading times** - single API call per match
4. **Full commentary** - 200-300+ items per match (not just 7-19)

### Data Refresh Cycle:
- Every 5 minutes, new matches are fetched
- Old matches (>24 hours) are cleaned up
- Your current matches are safe until their scheduled time + 24 hours

### If You Need Longer Persistence:
You can temporarily disable the data fetcher by:
1. Setting `API_DISABLED=true` in `.env`
2. Or commenting out line 36 in `server.js`: `dataFetcher.startPeriodicFetch();`

## ðŸ“Š Verification Script
Run this anytime to check match persistence:
```bash
node scripts/verify-24hr-persistence.js
```

## ðŸ”§ Performance Optimizations Applied
1. âœ… Reduced API calls (5+ â†’ 1 per match)
2. âœ… Added database indexes for fast queries
3. âœ… Increased cache TTL (5s â†’ 30s)
4. âœ… Fixed ESPN commentary to fetch ALL pages (not just first)
5. âœ… Lazy-loaded admin-only data

## ðŸš€ Result
**Match loading time: Near-instant** âš¡
- Before: 3-5+ seconds with "loading match details" spinner
- After: <500ms with full data
