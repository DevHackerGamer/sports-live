#  Welcome to Sports Live

**Sports Live** is a real-time broadcasting tool designed to deliver lightning-fast sports scores and updates to users. Currently built with React and Vercel serverless functions.


It was built to solve a common problem:  
*Fans, commentators, and organizers often lack a reliable, fast, and interactive way to track matches in real time without expensive third-party tools.*  

##  Project Context

- Sports organizations need to **share live match updates quickly**.  
- Fans want to **follow their favorite teams in real time**.  
- Commentators and analysts require **structured event data** for reporting.  

Sports Live bridges these needs with a **modern web app** powered by:  
- **Frontend:** React (interactive UI, Clerk authentication).  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express, deployed on **Render**.  
- **Database:** MongoDB for real-time storage.  
- **Authentication:** Clerk for secure user access.
