This document provides a detailed overview of the testing strategy, tools, workflows, and user feedback process for the **Sport Live Feeds** project.  
It ensures that our system is robust, reliable, and aligned with both stakeholder and user expectations.

## 1.Testing Framework

We are using:

- **Jest** â†’ for unit testing JavaScript functions and API logic. 
- **React Testing Library** â†’ for UI testing of React components.  
<!-- - **Supertest** â†’ Integration tests for backend API routes.-->  


### Why we Chose Jest:

We selected **Jest** as our testing framework because:  

- It's  **Easy to Setup** â†’ With no complex configuration.  
-  **Fast & Reliable** â†’ We can run the testing in Parallel, which is faster.
-  **Readable Syntax** â†’ Simple test functions (`test`, `expect`) make it easy for all team members to contribute.  
-  **Coverage Reporting** â†’ Built-in support for code coverage to track test completeness.  
- **It's a largely used Testing Framework** â†’ Widely used in React and Node.js projects.

Given our projectâ€™s **React frontend** and **Node.js API layer**, Jest was the **natural fit** for unit testing.

## 2. Test Setup & Installiation
- **Framework** â†’ [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)  
- **UI Testing** â†’ [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) 
- **API Testing** â†’ [Supertest](https://github.com/ladjs/supertest)  
---
## Installiation:
**Install Jest:**
```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```
**Install React Testing Library:**
```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom

```
**Configure package.json**
```bash
"scripts": {
  "test": "react-scripts test",
  "test:coverage": "react-scripts test --coverage --watchAll=false"
}


```
**Setup File(setupTests.js)**
In the root of your project create:
// setupTests.js:
```bash
import '@testing-library/jest-dom'; 
```
---

## 3.  Testing Strategy

We follow a **layered testing strategy**:

### Unit Tests
- Scope: Functions, React components in isolation, backend modules.  
- Example: Checking if `calculateScore()` returns the expected score.

### UI Tests
- Scope: Frontend components rendered in the browser environment.  
- Example: Switching tabs in `MatchViewer` and checking content changes.

### Integration Tests
- Scope: Components interacting together, API endpoints with database.  
- Example: Submitting a new event and verifying it appears in the match timeline.

### Error Handling & Edge Cases
- Scope: Invalid inputs, missing data, failed API calls.  
- Goal: Ensure app fails gracefully without breaking UI  
---
## 4. Testing Organization & Creating Test Files:
We follow **consistent naming:**
- Under src there is a folder where all our tests files are stored , called ___tests___
- Create a file under that file under that folder and ensure that
- All tests files end with .test.js
- Or you could have Tests are stored alongside components in each components folder as shown below

Our Folder Structure:

## 5. How to Run Automated Tests:
A small test by test description on how to run the automated tests for both frontend components and backend APIs. 
### 1. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have installed all project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
### 2. Run All Tests

To run every test (React + API):
```bash
npm test
```
This will:

- Discover all files ending with .test.js inside both src/ and api/.

- Run them in parallel.

- Display results in the terminal.

### 3. Run Coverage Report

To generate a code coverage report:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```
The summary appears in the terminal.

 ## Code Coverage Reports
- We track **line, function, branch, and statement coverage.**

- Configured in package.json â†’ jest.collectCoverageFrom:
```bash
"collectCoverageFrom": [
  "src/components/**/*.{js,jsx}",
  "src/lib/**/*.{js,jsx}",
  "src/app.js",
  "api/**/*.js",
  "!api/**/__tests__/**",
  "!src/**/*.test.{js,jsx}"
]
```

- Target: **80%+ coverage** across all major areas.

#### Example Coverage Output
```markdown 
File                   | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines
---------------------------------------------------------------
All files              |   84.12 |    78.34 |   80.27 |   84.99
 src/components/       |   82.14 |    75.00 |   79.00 |   83.00
 src/lib/              |   90.00 |    88.00 |   85.00 |   91.00
 api/                  |   87.50 |    80.00 |   83.00 |   86.75
---------------------------------------------------------------

```




## 7.  UI Testing

We use **React Testing Library**to simulate user interactions:

Rendering components correctly

Testing form submissions (e.g., adding a live event)

Checking that the UI updates when events are added/removed
Example Test:

---

## 9. Continuous Integration (CI/CD)

We use **GitHub Actions** to automate testing and coverage uploads.  
This ensures that every commit and pull request is validated before merging.

### Workflow File: `.github/workflows/tests.yml`

Our CI workflow runs on **push** and **pull_request** events.  

#### Steps Overview
1. **Checkout Repository**  
   - Pulls the code from GitHub so the workflow can run tests.

2. **Setup Node.js Environment**  
   - Ensures a consistent Node.js version (18.x) across local and CI builds.

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   - Runs `npm ci` to install dependencies based on `package-lock.json`.

4. **Run Tests with Coverage**  
   - Executes `npm run test:coverage` to generate test and coverage reports.

5. **Upload Coverage to Codecov**  
   - Sends the coverage report to Codecov for reporting on PRs and dashboards.

#### Example Workflow
```yaml
name: Tests and Coverage

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18.x

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci --silent
        env:
          NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL: error

      - name: Run Tests with Coverage
        run: npm run test:coverage
        env:
          CI: true
          NODE_OPTIONS: --max-old-space-size=4096 --no-warnings
          GENERATE_SOURCEMAP: false
          ESLINT_NO_DEV_ERRORS: true

      - name: Upload Coverage to Codecov
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}

```

## 10. Codecov Integration

We use **[Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/)** to track and visualize test coverage across the project.  
Codecov integrates directly into GitHub pull requests, so developers can see coverage changes immediately.  

### Why Codecov?
- **PR Comments** â†’ Coverage changes appear directly in GitHub PRs.  
- **Dashboards** â†’ View detailed reports of which files/functions lack tests.  
- **Threshold Enforcement** â†’ Optionally fail builds if coverage drops below a certain percentage.  

### Setup Steps
1. Sign in at [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) using GitHub.  
2. Add your repository.  
3. Generate a repository token.  
4. In GitHub:  
   - Navigate to **Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions**.  
   - Add a new repository secret:  
     - Name: `CODECOV_TOKEN`  
     - Value: `<your-generated-token>`  

### Example Workflow Snippet
Once the secret is added, the GitHub Actions workflow uploads coverage automatically:

## 11. Common Issues & Fixes

Here are recurring problems in test development and how we address them:  

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| **Found multiple elements with same text** | `getByText` matched more than one node | Use [`getAllByText`](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/bytext/#getallbytext) or add `within()` queries for precision |
| **Async tests failing** | Component hadnâ€™t finished rendering | Replace `getByText` with [`await findByText`](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-async/) |
| **Coverage missing for certain files** | Jestâ€™s `collectCoverageFrom` excluded them | Update `package.json` â†’ `"collectCoverageFrom": ["src/components/**/*.{js,jsx}", ...]` |
| **Memory leaks in Jest** | Long-running async calls or unmocked timers | Use [`jest.useFakeTimers()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/timer-mocks) or cleanup mocks in `afterEach` |
| **API tests timeout** | Real API calls too slow | Mock APIs with Jest, or increase timeout using [`jest.setTimeout(30000)`](https://jestjs.io/docs/jest-object#jestsettimeouttimeout) |

## 12. Closing Notes

Our testing and CI/CD strategy ensures:  

-  **Unit tests** validate business logic.  
-  **UI tests** confirm components behave correctly under user interaction.  
-  **Integration tests** verify frontend â†” backend communication.  
-  **Coverage reports** via [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) enforce accountability.  
-  **CI/CD pipelines** with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) guarantee every commit and pull request is tested.  
-  **User feedback** continuously improves our test suite with real-world insights.  

By combining **automation** with **user input**, we maintain **high confidence in code quality** while delivering features quickly and safely.
