title: Project Design
description: Technical system design, diagrams, data models, and UI/UX artifacts for the Sports Live Tracker project.
---

# 1. Introduction
This section documents the **technical design** of Sports Live Tracker.  
It includes **architecture, diagrams, UI/UX artifacts, data models, and deployment design**, ensuring a well-structured and scalable application.

---

# 2. System Architecture

- **Frontend (React + Tailwind)** â†’ User interface (dashboard, matches, standings).  
- **Backend (Node.js + Express)** â†’ APIs for authentication, matches, standings.  
- **Database (MongoDB Atlas)** â†’ Persistent storage of users, matches, teams, events.  
- **External API (https://www.football-data.org/)** â†’ Fetch additional football data.  
- **Deployment (Render)** â†’ Hosts frontend + backend services.

# 3. Data Flow
1. User interacts with **React frontend**.  
2. Frontend sends requests to **Express backend**.  
3. Backend retrieves data from **MongoDB** or **AllSportsAPI**.  
4. Updates pushed to UI in **real-time via WebSockets**.  

---

# 4. UI Design Artifacts

We created **wireframes in Figma** before coding.  

### Main Screens
- **Login & Registration** â†’ Simple Clerk-based authentication.  
- **Dashboard** â†’ Shows live matches + league standings.  
- **Match Viewer** â†’ Timeline of goals, cards, and events.  
- **Admin Match Setup** â†’ Create, edit, and delete matches.  
- **League Tables** â†’ View standings by competition.

# 5. UML Diagrams

### 5.1 Use Case Diagram
Shows how admins, viewers, and guests interact with the system.  
![Use Case Diagram](/diagrams/use.png)

- **Admin** â†’ Add/edit/remove matches, manage events.  
- **Viewer** â†’ View live scores, standings, follow teams.  
- **Guest** â†’ Access public matches.  

---

### 5.2 Component Diagram
High-level breakdown of frontend + backend layers.  
![Component Diagram](/diagrams/component.png)

- **Frontend (React)** â†’ Pages, reusable components (MatchCard, ScoreBoard).  
- **Backend (Express)** â†’ Auth service, match service, event service.  
- **Database (MongoDB)** â†’ Collections: users, matches, teams, events, standings.  

---

### 5.3 Sequence Diagram
Example: Admin adds a goal â†’ update propagates in real time to viewers.

# 6. Data Model (ER Diagram)

**Entities:** User, Team, Match, Event, Player, Standing.  

- **User** â†’ { id, name, email, role }  
- **Team** â†’ { id, name, league, crest }  
- **Match** â†’ { id, teamA, teamB, score, status }  
- **Event** â†’ { id, matchId, type, player, minute }  
- **Standing** â†’ { leagueId, teamId, points, position }

# 7. Deployment Diagram

- **Local Development** â†’ React + Express + MongoDB (Docker optional).  
- **Cloud Deployment** â†’ Render (frontend & backend), MongoDB Atlas.

# 8. Design Decisions & Notes
- **Chose MongoDB** for flexibility in handling match/event data.  
- **WebSockets** for real-time updates â†’ fallback polling in case of failure.  
- **Clerk Authentication** instead of Firebase/Auth0 â†’ easier integration + role-based access.  
- **League Standings** added after feedback â†’ required schema extension.  

---

# 9. Continuous Design Evolution
- Wireframes refined after tutor feedback (Sprint 2).  
- Database schema updated (added `standings` collection in Sprint 3).  
- Deployment optimized (moved from Vercel â†’ Render for simplicity).  
- Sequence diagram updated to reflect **live events propagation**.  

---

# 10. Conclusion
The **design artifacts** (wireframes, UML, ER models, architecture) provided the team with a **blueprint for implementation**.  
By iterating on the design each sprint, the system stayed aligned with **user needs, technical feasibility, and stakeholder feedback**.
