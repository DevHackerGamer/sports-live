description:  Backend architecture, API design, and serverless considerations for Sports Live Tracker.
---

The Sports Live Tracker backend provides a **scalable, secure, and performant API** for delivering live sports data, user preferences, and reporting functionality.

## Backend Technology Stack

- **Node.js + Express** → RESTful API framework.  
- **MongoDB** → Stores matches, events, users, and reports.  
- **Clerk** → Authentication and user identity management.  
- **Render** → Cloud platform for deployment with auto-scaling and HTTPS.  

### Key Features

- Auto-scaling API endpoints that handle traffic spikes automatically
- Built-in HTTPS and global CDN distribution
- Zero server management - focus on code, not infrastructure  
- Cost-effective pay-per-request pricing
- Excellent performance with edge computing

## API Structure

All API endpoints are located in the `/api` folder:

| Endpoint                | Purpose                                              |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `api/matches.js`        | Fetch live/upcoming matches                        |
| `api/players.js`        | Fetch player information                            |
| `api/teams.js`          | Fetch team information                              |
| `api/standings.js`      | Fetch league standings                              |
| `api/users.js`          | Handle user preferences (favorites)                |
| `api/reports.js`        | Create, fetch, and manage reports                  |
| `api/status.js`         | Health check endpoint                               |
| `api/uptime.js`         | System uptime monitoring         
                   
## Authentication

- **Clerk** provides user authentication and session management.  
- Clerk session tokens are validated by backend middleware.  
- Sensitive endpoints (`/api/reports`, `/api/users`) are protected by authentication checks.  
- Only authenticated users can create reports or manage favorites.

### Real-time Capabilities


The backend supports **real-time updates**:

- **Polling**: Frontend regularly fetches fresh data from endpoints
- **Webhooks**: External services can trigger immediate updates
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching of static and dynamic responses for optimal performance

---

### Running the Backend

For development with live API calls:
```bash
npm run dev
```




## Why this setup Works Great

- **Scalable**: Render handles automatic scaling of instances

- **Global Distribution**: CDN ensures low latency worldwide

- **Real-time Ready**: Supports polling, webhooks, and cached responses

- **Developer Friendly**: Simple local dev, build, and deploy workflow

- **Cost Efficient**: Pay only for active usage

 - **Persistent Storage**: MongoDB stores matches, events, users, and reports

 ## API Best Practices

- Use RESTful conventions: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

- Keep responses consistent and JSON-formatted

- Validate input data for all POST/PUT endpoints

- Protect sensitive endpoints with Clerk authentication

- Use caching and rate-limiting to optimize performance
