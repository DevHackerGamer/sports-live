## 5. Lessons Learned

- Real-time systems require careful **data flow and caching planning**.
- **Agile methodology** helps manage complex projects but needs strong time estimates.
- Proper **environment and dependency management** prevents deployment issues.
- **User feedback** is essential for iterating and improving UX/UI.

---

## 6. Recommendations for Future Work

- Expand API integrations for additional leagues and data points.
- Enhance reporting features with advanced analytics and visualizations.
- Improve automated testing coverage for frontend and backend.
- Implement more accessibility and personalization options.
- Consider serverless or edge computing solutions for scalability.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The project successfully met its main functional and non-functional objectives, delivering a usable, responsive, and real-time sports tracking application. While some areas such as testing coverage and advanced analytics can be improved, the system demonstrates the effectiveness of Agile methodology, collaborative workflows, and modern web technologies.
