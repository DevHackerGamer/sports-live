title: Project Management Methodology
description: Our chosen project management methology for our Sports Live Tracker

---

### Chosen Methodology: Agile (Scrum Framework)

We use the **Agile methodology**, following the **Scrum framework**, to ensure flexibility, collaboration, and continuous delivery of working software.

---

### Why Agile for Sport Live Feeds?

- Requirements may evolve after stakeholder feedback.
- Frequent delivery allows us to adapt quickly.
- Encourages transparency, communication, and accountability.
- Short iterations keep progress measurable and visible.

#### Why Scrum Instead of Alternatives?  
- **Waterfall**: Sequential and rigid, not ideal since requirements evolved after stakeholder reviews.    
- **Scrum**: Balanced approachâ€”short sprints, clear roles, structured reviews, and room for continuous improvement.  
---
Scrum therefore enabled us to deliver incremental value while adapting quickly to evolving feedback.  


####  We work in **two-week sprints**, providing enough time for meaningful progress while maintaining rapid feedback loops


### Scrum Process

### Roles
- **Product Owner** â€“ Represents stakeholder interests and prioritizes backlog.
- **Scrum Master** â€“ Facilitates ceremonies, removes blockers.
- **Development Team** â€“ Builds, tests, and delivers product increments.

### Ceremonies
1. **Sprint Planning** â€“ Define sprint goals, select backlog items, estimate work.
2. **Daily Standups** â€“ Quick syncs to report progress and highlight blockers.
3. **Sprint Review** â€“ Demo completed features to stakeholders and gather feedback.
4. **Sprint Retrospective** â€“ Identify improvements for the next sprint.

---
## Stakeholder Interaction  

- **Tutor Reviews**: At the end of each sprint, we demoed progress to our tutor.  
- **Example**: After Sprint 2, tutor feedback suggested enhancing database schema for better player/team linking. We adapted in Sprint 3.  
- **Transparency**: Regular updates through Whatsapp messages,Discord Meetings and shared Notion boards ensured the tutor was always aware of project status.

## Tools Used
- **Notion** â€“ Central hub for sprint boards, backlog, and documentation.
- **Discord** â€“ Async communication, quick updates, and stakeholder coordination.
- **Whatsapp** â€“ for easy and more frequent communication and updates

## Workflow Structure

### Sprint Length
- Each sprint runs for **2 weeks**.

### Planning and Meetings

| Meeting              | Frequency            | Format               | Purpose                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Sprint Planning**  | Every second Tuesday | In-person            | Plan the sprint, estimate tasks          |
| **Sprint Check-ins** | 3x per week          | Discord              | Review progress, unblock teammates       |
| **Sprint Review**    | Every Day            | In-person/Discord/Whatsapp  | Discuss features, collect feedback          |
 **Retrospective**    | End of sprint        | In-Person on Sprint Marking             | Reflect on process, define improvements  |

## Proof of Agile in Action
Below are real examples of how Agile was applied in our project:  

### 1. We maintain our project board in **Notion**:

---
## Definition of Done (DoD)  
- Code reviewed and merged.  
- Feature tested and passes QA.  
- Documentation updated.  
- Stakeholder acceptance obtained.  

---

## Continuous Improvement  
- Retrospective action items applied in next sprint.  
- Regular evaluation of workflow and tools.  
- Experimentation with new practices for efficiency.  

---

## Review of Methodology  

### What Worked Well
- Short sprints kept progress visible and manageable.  
- Notion and Discord made task tracking and communication effective.  
- Regular reviews gave the tutor confidence in progress.  

### Challenges Faced
- Team sometimes struggled with sprint deadlines.  
- Daily standups were occasionally missed due to scheduling conflicts.  
- Scope creep when new features were suggested mid-sprint.  

### Improvements for Future
- Stronger sprint planning with clearer task estimates.  
- Automating testing and deployments earlier.
