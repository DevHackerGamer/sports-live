title: Project Management Methodology
description: Our chosen project management methology for our Sports Live Tracker

---

### Chosen Methodology: Agile (Scrum Framework)

We use the **Agile methodology**, following the **Scrum framework**, to ensure flexibility, collaboration, and continuous delivery of working software.

---

### Why Agile for Sport Live Feeds?

- Requirements may evolve after stakeholder feedback.
- Frequent delivery allows us to adapt quickly.
- Encourages transparency, communication, and accountability.
- Short iterations keep progress measurable and visible.


We work in **two-week sprints**, providing enough time for meaningful progress while maintaining rapid feedback loops
---

### Scrum Process

### Roles
- **Product Owner** – Represents stakeholder interests and prioritizes backlog.
- **Scrum Master** – Facilitates ceremonies, removes blockers.
- **Development Team** – Builds, tests, and delivers product increments.

### Ceremonies
1. **Sprint Planning** – Define sprint goals, select backlog items, estimate work.
2. **Daily Standups** – Quick syncs to report progress and highlight blockers.
3. **Sprint Review** – Demo completed features to stakeholders and gather feedback.
4. **Sprint Retrospective** – Identify improvements for the next sprint.

## Tools Used
- **React** – Frontend framework for building fast, responsive UI.
- **Notion** – Central hub for sprint boards, backlog, and documentation.
- **Discord** – Async communication, quick updates, and stakeholder coordination.
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and CI/CD deployment.
- **VS Code** – Main IDE for coding and configuration.

## Workflow Structure  


## **Architecture Overview**

**Frontend** – **React**
- Renders UI components for login, dashboard, preferences, match setup, and live input.
- Fetches data from backend APIs and WebSockets for live updates.

**Backend API** – Node.js + Express
- RESTful endpoints for matches, events, and preferences.
- WebSocket support for real-time updates.

**Database** – PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- Stores match info, events, player/team data, and user preferences.

**Deployment** – GitHub Pages / Hosting via CI/CD
- Automatic build and deploy from the `main` branch.

---

## **Deployment Process**

1. **Branching Strategy**
   - Features: `feature/<name>`
   - Fixes: `fix/<name>`
   - Merge via pull requests to `main`.

2. **Build & Test**
   - `astro build` runs locally and in CI.
   - Manual QA for dashboard, event feed, and live updates.

3. **Deployment**
   - Push to `main` triggers GitHub Actions.
   - Astro build output deployed to GitHub Pages or hosting service.

4. **Post-Deployment**
   - Verify live environment against sprint goals.
   - Perform smoke tests.
