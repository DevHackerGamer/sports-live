## Why This Stack

The technology stack was chosen to meet the following core project requirements:

- **Real-Time Performance**  
  Node.js handles multiple concurrent match updates efficiently, while React’s virtual DOM ensures smooth, live updates to the user interface. MongoDB’s flexible schema allows instant updates to match stats and event logs.

- **Scalability**  
  Render automatically scales both the frontend and backend to handle traffic spikes, such as during popular matches. MongoDB Atlas provides horizontal scaling and global clusters to support fans worldwide.

- **Developer Experience**  
  Modern tool like React allows rapid development and prototyping with reusable components, and responsive UI design. Clerk simplifies authentication and user session management.

- **Integration with External Data**  
  Football-Data.org API delivers reliable live match data. Our backend APIs wrap these feeds, ensuring consistent formatting and allowing manual overrides when necessary.

- **Reliability**  
  Render and MongoDB Atlas offer monitoring, automatic failover, and high availability. Combined with version-controlled workflows and automated testing, this ensures the system is stable and maintainable.

- **Cost Effectiveness**  
  Using Render’s  hosting and Atlas cloud database minimizes operational costs while maintaining performance and reliability.
