# User Feedback

## 1. Overview  
To ensure **continuous improvement** and a **user-centered design**, we implemented a **formal user feedback process** starting in **Sprint 2**.  
The goal was to validate usability, design, and feature functionality by collecting insights from early testers (friends, classmates, family members, and peers).  

---
## 2. Feedback Collection Process  

- **Tool Used**: Google Forms  
- **Distribution**: Shared via WhatsApp groups, email invitations, and direct sharing with testers.  
- **Response Window**: Open since Sprint 2 and extended into Sprint 3.  
- **Sample Size**: Over 20+ respondents.  
- **Data Export**: Responses exported to **Google Sheets** for structured analysis.  

📄 **Resources:**  
- [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdsmVo4ieYDYNuOySYeTuYOd8mSVJHRGRu1p079odEO8CoeDg/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=107333351345523887718)

## 4. Feedback Evaluation Process  

We followed a structured evaluation method:  

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed duplicates/incomplete submissions.   

2. **Quantitative Analysis** (scaled questions)  
   - Calculated averages and distribution for navigation, design, timeline clarity, and overall satisfaction.  
   - Benchmarks:  
     - ≥4.0 = strong performance.  
     - 3.0–3.9 = moderate, needs improvement.  
     - <3.0 = critical weakness.  

3. **Qualitative Analysis** (text responses)  
   - Grouped answers into categories: **Performance, Design, Features, Improvements**.  
   - Counted frequency of each theme.  
    



5. **Prioritization**  
   - Used an **Impact vs Effort Matrix** to decide development order:  
     - High Impact / Low Effort → Sprint 3 fixes (UI refinements).  
     - High Impact / High Effort → Sprint 4+ (push notifications, dark mode).  
     - Low Impact → Logged for future.  

6. **Integration**  
   - Converted top feedback themes into **product backlog items**.  
   - Linked them to Sprint deliverables.  
   - Planned to re-test improvements in Sprint 4.

## 5. Feedback Analysis  

### 5.1 Quantitative Results  

| Question | Avg. Score (1–5) | Key Insight |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| Ease of navigation | **4.2** | Users found navigation simple overall but could be improved |
| Overall design & layout | **4.1** | Layout considered clean, but some requested more contrast. |
| First impression of scoreboard | **4.0** | Scoreboard clear, but a few users found it busy, and could have more match details |
| Overall satisfaction | **4.3** | Majority of testers satisfied with the experience. |

### 5.2 Qualitative Results  

- **Most Used Features:**  
  - Match Viewer and Event Timeline.  
- **Reported Issues:**

## 6. Insights & Actions  

| Feedback Theme | User Need | Planned Action |
|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Performance** | Faster live updates | Optimize API polling from Mongo mabye with filtering |
| **Navigation** | Streamlined setup | Simplify match/team creation flow |
| **Customization** | More control for users | Add dark mode + notifications |
| **Feature Gaps** | Alerts for events | Push notifications in Sprint 4 |


## 7. Next Steps  

- Keep collecting responses during Sprint 3.  
- Conduct **usability tests** (screen recordings) 
- Compare **before/after results** in Sprint 4 to measure improvement.  
- Expand tester pool to include non-friends/family for less biased results.
