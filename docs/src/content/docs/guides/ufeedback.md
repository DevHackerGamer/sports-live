# User Feedback

## 1. Overview  
To ensure **continuous improvement** and a **user-centered design**, we implemented a **formal user feedback process** starting in **Sprint 2**.  
The goal was to validate usability, design, and feature functionality by collecting insights from early testers (friends, classmates, and family members).

## 2. Feedback Collection Process  

- **Tool Used**: Google Forms  
- **Distribution**: Shared via WhatsApp groups, with family members , friends and with other testers
- **Response Window**: Open since Sprint 2 and extended into Sprint 3.  
- **Sample Size**: Over 20+ respondents.  
- **Data Export**: Responses exported to **Google Sheets** for structured analysis.

## 6. Feedback Evaluation Process  

We followed a structured evaluation method:  

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed duplicates/incomplete submissions.   

2. **Quantitative Analysis** (scaled questions)  
   - Calculated averages and distribution for navigation, design, timeline clarity, and overall satisfaction.  
   - Benchmarks:  
     - â‰¥4.0 = strong performance.  
     - 3.0â€“3.9 = moderate, needs improvement.  
     - <3.0 = critical weakness.  

3. **Qualitative Analysis** (text responses)  
   - Grouped answers into categories: **Performance, Design, Features, Improvements**.  
   - Counted frequency of each theme.  
    



4. **Prioritization**  
   - Used an **Impact vs Effort Matrix** to decide development order:  
     - High Impact / Low Effort â†’ Sprint 3 fixes (UI refinements).  
     - High Impact / High Effort â†’ Sprint 4+ (push notifications, dark mode).  
     - Low Impact â†’ Logged for future.

## 7. Insights & Actions  

| Feedback Theme | User Need | Planned Action |
|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Performance** | Faster live updates | Optimize API polling from Mongo mabye with filtering |
| **Navigation** | Streamlined setup | Simplify match/team creation flow |
| **Customization** | More control for users | Add dark mode + notifications |
| **Feature Gaps** | Alerts for events | Push notifications in Sprint 4 |


## 8. Next Steps  

- Keep collecting responses during Sprint 3.  
- Conduct **usability tests** (screen recordings) 
- Compare **before/after results** in Sprint 4 to measure improvement.  
- Expand tester pool to include non-friends/family for less biased results.
